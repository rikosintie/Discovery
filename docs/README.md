## ASCIINEMA video

Here is an [asciinema video](https://asciinema.org/a/726423) that shows the script running. In the video there are switches that have:

- ssh V1 which isn't supported
- a switch that didn't accept the credentials given
- a switch that didn't respond

The script notes these issues, saves the `hostname, ip address, reason` to a file. It then moves onto the next device.

If you use the terminal daily, I highly recommend checking out [ascinema](https://asciinema.org/a/726423). It's an open source tool that lets you:

"Record and share your terminal sessions, the simple way.
Forget screen recording apps and blurry video. Experience a lightweight, text-based approach to terminal recording."
