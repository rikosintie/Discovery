# Security Policy

The Network Discovery community (Hubbard) has adopted this security disclosures and response policy to ensure we responsibly handle critical issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### When you should?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Pterodactyl.
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Pterodactyl.
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Pterodactyl depends on. For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there.

### When you should not?

- You need help tuning the components for security
- You need help applying security-related updates.
- Your issue is not security-related.

### Please use the below process to report a vulnerability to the project

Email the **Networkd Discovery security group at mhubbard -@- gmail.com**

The email should contain:

- description of the problem
- precise and detailed steps (include screenshots) that created the problem
- the affected version(s)
- any possible mitigations, if known
