# Security Policy

The Pterodactyl community has adopted this security disclosures and response policy to ensure we responsibly handle critical issues.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### When you should?

- You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Pterodactyl.
- You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Pterodactyl.
- You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Pterodactyl depends on. For projects with their own vulnerability reporting and disclosure process, please report it directly there.

### When you should not?

- You need help tuning Pterodactyl components for security
- You need help applying security-related updates.
- Your issue is not security-related.

### Please use the below process to report a vulnerability to the project

Email the **Pterodactyl security group at mhubbard -@- programmingunlimited.com**

Emails should contain:
* description of the problem
* precise and detailed steps (include screenshots) that created the problem
* the affected version(s)
* any possible mitigations, if known
